        <p>Hey there, I am Emma, a passionate food lover from Sichuan, China, which is known for its delicious and spicy cuisine! </p>
        ​<p>Growing up in Sichuan, I was surrounded by all kinds of tasty food. I found it difficult to find the authentic Sichuan flavour from restaurants while living abroad, so I decided to create my own kitchen to recreate the authentic taste. I are on a mission to introduce the amazing Sichuan cuisine to as many people as possible. In Emma’s Kitchen, I will share every key step to get the most authentic flavour with you. </p>
