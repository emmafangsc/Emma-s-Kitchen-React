        <div>
            <p>Those who know me well know I suffer Jesus Syndrome. I enjoy helping others achieve their goals and made my mission out of it. For that reason, I stopped coding five years ago and devoted myself to becoming a better leader, coach, and person in general.</p> <br/>
            <p>My education consisted of Multimedia Engineering, specializing in Videogames.</p> <br/>
            <p>In my professional journey, I’ve led teams of all sorts and sizes across different countries, mostly in the game industry. I have also coached individuals based on co-active coaching and I keep myself active as a college lecturer at Universitat Tecnocampus Mataró.</p> <br/>
            <p>I did not write a book yet but planted many trees and had one wonderful kid.</p>
