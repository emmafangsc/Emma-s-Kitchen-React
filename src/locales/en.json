I found it difficult to find the authentic Sichuan flavour from restaurants while living abroad, so I decided to create my own kitchen to recreate the authentic taste. I are on a mission to introduce the amazing Sichuan cuisine to as many people as possible. In Emma’s Kitchen, I will share every key step to get the most authentic flavour with you."
